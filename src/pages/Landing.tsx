/*
 * Landing — a single conversion funnel.
 *
 * One primary action everywhere on this page: Get started free (Platform
 * register). "Book a demo" is the only secondary action and it opens in place,
 * as an accelerator for teams that want a guided walkthrough, never a gate in
 * front of signup. Enterprise buyers reach sales from the pricing card. There
 * is no sign-in anywhere on the page, and the nav is the focused variant: a
 * few on-page anchors plus the primary button.
 *
 * Written for the decision-maker who owns security but isn't a specialist, and
 * ordered problem → what you get → proof → trust → how to start → price → close.
 *
 * Retired from this page (components kept for other routes or future use):
 * Marquee (sector list said nothing a buyer could act on), Principles (merged
 * into PrivacyModel's argument), PentestAgent, Lifecycle, Coverage and
 * PlatformTeaser (five sections restating Capabilities), SandboxSection and
 * FreeScanSection (competing offers that split the funnel), and the pricing
 * engagement band (still on /pricing).
